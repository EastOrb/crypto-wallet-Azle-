# Crypto-Wallet

A decentralized user management system with transaction and point tracking capabilities using Azle and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

## Overview

Crypto-Wallet is a decentralized platform where users can register, deposit funds, make transactions, and redeem points. The platform utilizes Internet Computer (ICP) and Azle to manage users, transactions, and points in a secure and scalable manner, providing a decentralized approach to wallet and transaction management.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Allows users to create accounts with personal details such as first name, last name, email, and phone number. A unique username is generated automatically.
- **Fund Deposit:** Users can deposit funds into their accounts and manage their balances.
- **Transactions:** Users can send funds to other users, with transaction history stored in a decentralized manner.
- **Points System:** Points are awarded based on transaction amounts, and users can redeem accumulated points for rewards.
- **Transaction History:** Users can view a history of their transactions.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Users can check their account balances.
- **Points Inquiry:** Users can check their accumulated points balance.
